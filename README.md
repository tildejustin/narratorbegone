**NarratorBeGone** is a Minecraft mod that automatically disables the hard-coded narrator key binding. Enjoy
uninterrupted gameplay without accidentally toggling the narrator!

## Installation

1. Download the mod from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/narratorbegone) or
   the [Releases](https://github.com/7orivorian/NarratorBeGone/releases) page.
2. Place the downloaded `.jar` file into your Minecraft mods folder.
3. Launch Minecraft Fabric.

That's it! The mod will automatically disable the narrator key binding upon launch.

## Compatibility

**NarratorBeGone** is designed for use with `Fabric Minecraft 1.20.1` **only**. However, if this mod gets enough support
I'd be happy to backport it to older versions!
